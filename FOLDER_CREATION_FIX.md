# Google Drive Folder Creation - Issue Resolution

## Problem
The API was not creating folders in Google Drive when reports were submitted.

## Root Cause
The issue was **NOT with the folder creation code itself**, but with the **folder ID configuration**:

1. **Invalid Folder IDs**: Both `.env` and `.env.development` contained folder IDs that either:
   - Don't exist
   - Are not accessible to the service account
   
2. **Service Account Access**: The service account (`unlicensedschooladmin@unlicesnseddrivingschooldev.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) did not have permission to access the folders specified in the environment variables.

## Solution

### 1. Created a New Accessible Folder
Created a new folder in the service account's own Drive that it automatically has access to:
- **Folder ID**: `1CS0GJ3V0xIru4_kLerZLIT6-BeEY8kPP`
- **Folder Name**: `NJDSC_Reports_2025-09-30T14-30-42-363Z`
- **View Link**: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CS0GJ3V0xIru4_kLerZLIT6-BeEY8kPP
- **Shared with**: larryf@mrbrooks.biz (Writer access)

### 2. Updated Configuration
Updated `.env` file with the working folder ID:
```
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=1CS0GJ3V0xIru4_kLerZLIT6-BeEY8kPP
```

### 3. Added Private Key Fix
Enhanced `server/services/googleDriveService.js` to handle private key formatting issues:
```javascript
// Fix private key formatting if needed (replace literal \n with actual newlines)
if (credentials.private_key && credentials.private_key.includes('\\n')) {
  credentials.private_key = credentials.private_key.replace(/\\n/g, '\n');
}
```

## Test Results

### ✅ All Tests Passing
1. **Basic folder creation**: Successfully creates folders in service account's Drive
2. **Subfolder creation**: Successfully creates report-specific subfolders
3. **API folder creation**: The `getOrCreateReportFolder()` function works correctly
4. **Duplicate detection**: Correctly returns existing folders instead of creating duplicates
5. **Multiple reports**: Can create folders for multiple different reports

### Test Evidence
```
Test folder 1 (rep_TEST01): 1qUIWG6R63ZUUEr4-uoK2fa91FuguBIOL
Test folder 2 (rep_TEST02): 1ysU6JIQ7a7iFdL8cV6rbNKAlfRMrwj_0
```

## How to Use Your Own Folder

If you want to use a specific folder in your personal Google Drive:

### Option 1: Share Existing Folder with Service Account
1. Go to your Google Drive folder
2. Right-click → Share
3. Add the service account email: `unlicensedschooladmin@unlicesnseddrivingschooldev.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
4. Give it "Editor" permissions
5. Copy the folder ID from the URL
6. Update `.env` with that folder ID

### Option 2: Use the Service Account's Folder
1. Keep using the folder we created: `1CS0GJ3V0xIru4_kLerZLIT6-BeEY8kPP`
2. Share this folder with your personal Google account to view it
3. All report folders will be created as subfolders inside it

## Files Created for Testing

1. **`create_test_folder.js`** - Creates a new folder in service account's Drive
2. **`test_folder_creation.js`** - Tests folder creation with detailed diagnostics
3. **`test_api_folder_creation.js`** - Tests the actual API's folder creation function

## Next Steps

The folder creation is now working. To apply this to your actual API:

1. ✅ **Configuration Updated**: `.env` now has the correct folder ID
2. ✅ **Code Fixed**: `googleDriveService.js` handles private key formatting
3. ✅ **Tested**: All folder creation functionality verified

Your API should now successfully create folders when reports are submitted!

## Important Notes

- The folder ID in `.env.development` (`1pKpweWqwq8X2BEd3RRzOy439_3tJMDxq`) is not accessible
- If you need to use that folder, you must share it with the service account first
- The service account credentials in `.env` are valid and working
- The credentials in `.env.development` had an invalid private key (different key ID)
