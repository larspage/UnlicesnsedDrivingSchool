### Communication Protocols
- **Daily Standups:** Virtual meetings to discuss progress and blockers
- **Code Reviews:** Cross-agent review of interface changes
- **Integration Testing:** Automated validation of contract compliance
- **Documentation Updates:** Real-time maintenance of shared docs

### Quality Gates
- **Unit Tests:** Must pass for all owned components (80%+ coverage)
- **Integration Tests:** Must validate interface compliance
- **Code Reviews:** Required for all interface changes
- **Security Scan:** Automated security testing
- **Performance Tests:** Baseline performance requirements met
