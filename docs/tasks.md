## Agent Coordination Guidelines

### Parallel Development Principles
- **Interface Contracts:** All agent interfaces defined upfront in documentation
- **Independent Testing:** Each agent maintains their own test suites
- **Daily Integration:** Automated integration testing prevents blocking
- **Clear Ownership:** No component owned by multiple agents
- **Documentation-Driven:** Real-time updates to shared documentation

### Communication Protocols
- **Daily Standups:** Virtual meetings to discuss progress and blockers
- **Code Reviews:** Cross-agent review of interface changes
- **Integration Testing:** Automated validation of contract compliance
- **Documentation Updates:** Real-time maintenance of shared docs

### Quality Gates
- **Unit Tests:** Must pass for all owned components (80%+ coverage)
- **Integration Tests:** Must validate interface compliance
- **Code Reviews:** Required for all interface changes
- **Security Scan:** Automated security testing
- **Performance Tests:** Baseline performance requirements met
