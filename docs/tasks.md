### Communication Protocols
- **Daily Standups:** Virtual meetings to discuss progress and blockers
- **Code Reviews:** Cross-agent review of interface changes
- **Integration Testing:** Automated validation of contract compliance
- **Documentation Updates:** Real-time maintenance of shared docs

### Quality Gates
