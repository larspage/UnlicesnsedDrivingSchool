### ‚è≥ **Phases 5-8: Core Features to Deployment** - PENDING
- User interface components need development
- Report submission and viewing functionality pending
- Admin features not yet implemented
- Integration testing and deployment preparation needed

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Implement Reports API** (`/api/reports`) - Enable report submission and retrieval
2. **Implement Files API** (`/api/files`) - Enable file upload functionality
3. **Expand Frontend Components** - Build report form and data display components
4. **Integration Testing** - Test end-to-end data flow from frontend to Google Sheets

**Current Blockers:** Reports and Files API endpoints are placeholders, preventing frontend development from proceeding with real data.

- **Independent Testing:** Each agent maintains their own test suites
- **Daily Integration:** Automated integration testing prevents blocking
- **Clear Ownership:** No component owned by multiple agents
- **Documentation-Driven:** Real-time updates to shared documentation

### Communication Protocols
- **Daily Standups:** Virtual meetings to discuss progress and blockers
- **Code Reviews:** Cross-agent review of interface changes
- **Integration Testing:** Automated validation of contract compliance
- **Documentation Updates:** Real-time maintenance of shared docs

### Quality Gates
- **Unit Tests:** Must pass for all owned components (80%+ coverage)
- **Integration Tests:** Must validate interface compliance
- **Code Reviews:** Required for all interface changes
- **Security Scan:** Automated security testing
- **Performance Tests:** Baseline performance requirements met
