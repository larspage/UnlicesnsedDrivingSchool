# NJDSC School Compliance Portal - Development Phases

## Overview

This document organizes the development of the NJDSC School Compliance Portal into clear phases designed for parallel AI agent development. Each phase includes specific agent assignments, deliverables, and success criteria to ensure efficient collaboration and minimal dependencies.

### Development Principles
