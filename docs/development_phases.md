# NJDSC School Compliance Portal - Development Phases

## Overview

This document organizes the development of the NJDSC School Compliance Portal into clear phases designed for parallel AI agent development. Each phase includes specific agent assignments, deliverables, and success criteria to ensure efficient collaboration and minimal dependencies.

### Development Principles
- **Parallel Execution:** Multiple agents work simultaneously within phases
- **Interface Contracts:** Clear APIs defined upfront to prevent blocking
- **Incremental Delivery:** Each phase produces testable, deployable increments
- **Quality Gates:** Automated testing and code review at phase boundaries
- **Risk Mitigation:** Critical path items prioritized, dependencies minimized

### Phase Structure
- **Duration:** 1-2 weeks per phase
- **Team Size:** 8-12 agents working in parallel
- **Quality Gates:** Unit tests (80%+ coverage), integration tests, code review
- **Deliverables:** Functional code, tests, documentation updates

## Current Project Status

The infrastructure foundation is complete. The data layer is undergoing architectural changes from Google Workspace to local JSON file storage on DigitalOcean droplets, enabling cost-effective deployment.
